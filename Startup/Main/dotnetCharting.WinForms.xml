            <summary>This class offers the ability to find the function of best fit in accordance with the least squares approach where the function is constructed as the sum of a collection of basis functions.</summary>
            <remarks>    The basis functions are set using the method FunctionBasis) and     allow complete flexibility over the functions which are used in     order to construct the sum which will form the function is best     fit.     Details concerning the Function of Best Fit     The function is best fit is constructed from a linear     combination of basis functions f_1(x), f_2(x), ...,     f_n(x), where the basis functions are set using     FunctionBasis). That is, the function of best fit can be any     function which takes the form:     a_1 * f_1(x) + a_2 * f_2(x) + ... + a_n *     f_n(x),     where a_1,..., a_n are any real numbers.     The Least Square Approach     When we refer to the function of best fit strictly     speaking we are refering to the function constructed as a     linear combination of basis functions constructed by the     following means. The coefficients are selected such that the     resulting function has the maximum likelyhood of being the best     fit in accordance with the least squares approach when the     measurement errors of the y-axis coordinates of the known data     points are given.     This implementation we offer the ability to incorporate     measurement errors within the observed data by which the     function it fit. In particular, we assume that the measurement     errors of the y_i's are independently random and     distributed as a Normal Guassian distribution about a true     value. It follows from these assumptions (though not     rigorously) that the most likely coefficients which generate     the best fit are acheived by finding the coefficients: a_1,     ..., a_n such that the sum of the squares of the     terms:     ( y_i - (a_1 * f_1(x_i) + ... + a_n * f_n(x_i)) \     sigma_i,     is minimized where we sum over the i, for 1     &lt;= i &lt;= m; where m is the number of data     points, namely (x_i, y_i); f_1,..., f_n are the     function basis elements and the sigma_i of the standard     deviation of the measurement error of the values of     y_i.     Remarks:                       Measurement Error Unknown: If you do not wish         to incorporate measurement error within the select of the         greatest likelyhood coefficient then just set all the         standard deviations of each of the errors to         1.         Weighted Best Fit: If you wish you are also         able to apply this class with the view of finding the best         weighted fit where the sigma_icorresponds the weight         applied to the i-th data point.         Chi-Squared Measure: The value of the sum of         the above terms is referred to as the Chi-Squared measure.         Clearly the lower the absolute value of this measure the         better (globally) over the range of value the curve         selected fits the given data.               Using this class     In order to apply this class you must perform the     following steps:                       Set the Basis Functions: using         FunctionBasis)         Fit the Function set to the Data: using         Boolean[]) or SetGeneralFitOrdered               Once the function has been fit you are able to ``read''     the following quantitative information about the fitted     function:                       Return the value of Chi-Squared using         GetChiSquare         Return the coefficients in the function of best fit         using GetCoefficients         Evaluate the value of the function of best fit at a         given point using Double)          </remarks>

            <remarks>    The Chi-Square is a convenient measure of how well (globally)     over the range considered the function of best fit, fits the     data considered.     Remark: Roughly speaking for an unweighted     function of best fit the square root of the chi-Squared measure     is average distance from the curve of the best fit to a data     point in the y-axis direction.     What is Chi-Squared?     Recall that here we are finding the curve of best fit in     accordance with minimizing the sum of the squares of the     terms:     ( y_i - (a_1 * f_1(x_i) + ... + a_n * f_n(x_i)) /     sigma_i,     where we sum over the i, for 1 &lt;= i &lt;=     n; the (x_i, y_i) are the data points, f_1,...,     f_n are the function basis elements and the sigma_i     are the standard deviation of the measurement error of the     values of y_i. The Chi-Squared measure is     precisely the value of this sum.</remarks>

That is,     coefficients are selected such the points (x_i, f(x_i)),     for i=1,...,m; are a best fit for the given data set     (x_i, y_i), i=1,...,m.     Fixing some Coefficients     Please note that within this implementation we reserve     the right to fix some of the coefficients before the function     is fitted. In such instances the above described fitting is     performed with some of the coefficients fixed to the initial     value which they are given. The fit parameter is used in     order to determine which (if any) of the coefficient are kept     fixed during the fitting.     Measure Errors or Weighted Best Fit     In addition as mentioned within the overview of this     class you are able to incorporate one of the following features     when determining the greatest likelyhood coefficients:                       Measure Error: You are able to find the         greatest likelyhood coefficients when the measure error         (i.e. the standard deviations of the errors of the         observation so the y_i's). In order to fit the         function taking into account the measurment error you are         required to provide the k-th term of the parameter         sigmaas the measurement error of the y_k         (i.e. the value of the y-axis corrdinate of the k-th data         point which in used within the fitting of the         function.

            <summary>This class offers the ability to find the function of best fit in accordance with the least squares approach where the function considered is provided as a sequence of method calls rather than as a user defined :server:, as detail below.</summary>
            <remarks>    Details concerning the Function of Best Fit     The function is best fit is constructed from a linear     combination of basis functions f_1(x), f_2(x), ...,     f_n(x), where the basis functions are set using itterative     basis building procedure as detailed below. That is, the     function of best fit can be any function which takes the     form:     a_1 * f_1(x) + a_2 * f_2(x) + ... + a_n *     f_n(x),     where a_1,..., a_n are any real numbers.     Providing the Function to Fit via the Factor Model     The function of best fit is constructed as the linear sum     of functions: f_1(x), f_2(x),..., f_n(x) where each of     the individual functions are given by calling one of the     methods:                       Double) - Add a basis constant function.         Double[]) - Add a basis function which is a sum of         power terms.         Double[]) - Add a basis function which is a sum of a         rational where the denominator and numerator which our         themselves sums of power terms.         Double[]) - Add a basis function which is a sum of         Cosine functions.         Double[]) - Add a basis function which is a sum of         Sine functions.         Double[]) - Add a basis function which is a sum of         Tangent functions.         Double[]) - Add a basis function which is a sum of         Logarithm functions.         Double[]) - Add a basis funtion which is a sum of         Exponential functions.         Double[]) - Add a basis function which is a sum of         absolute functions.         Double[]) - Add a basis functiopn which is a sum of         step functions.               That is, we construct the function which is to be fitted     by itteratively added terms to the basis elements from which it     is constructed. We illustrate exactly how this works withint he     following example.     Example of the Factor Model Function Builder     Say we wish to fit the function of the following type to     the data set considered:     f(x) = (a_1 * x) + (a_2 * sin(x+3) ) + (a_3 *     2)     where the terms a_1, a_2, a_3, are just constants     which are yet to be decided.is constructed as the sum of     a collection of basis functions. The basis functions are set     using the method SetFunctionBasis and allow complete     flexibility over the functions which are used in order to     construct the sum which will form the function is best fit.     The Least Square Approach     When we refer to the function of best fit strictly     speaking we are refering to the function constructed as a     linear combination of basis functions constructed by the     following means. The coefficients are selected such that the     resulting function has the maximum likelyhood of being the best     fit in accordance with the least squares approach when the     measurement errors of the y-axis coordinates of the known data     points are given.     This implementation we offer the ability to incorporate     measurement errors within the observed data by which the     function it fit. In particular, we assume that the measurement     errors of the y_i's are independently random and     distributed as a Normal Guassian distribution about a true     value. It follows from these assumptions (though not     rigorously) that the most likely coefficients which generate     the best fit are acheived by finding the coefficients: a_1,     ..., a_n such that the sum of the squares of the     terms:     ( y_i - (a_1 * f_1(x_i) + ... + a_n * f_n(x_i)) \     sigma_i,     is minimized where we sum over the i, for 1     &lt;= i &lt;= m; where m is the number of data     points, namely (x_i, y_i); f_1,..., f_n are the     function basis elements and the sigma_i of the standard     deviation of the measurement error of the values of     y_i.     Remarks:                       Measurement Error Unknown: If you do not wish         to incorporate measurement error within the select of the         greatest likelyhood coefficient then just set all the         standard deviations of each of the errors to         1.         Weighted Best Fit: If you wish you are also         able to apply this class with the view of finding the best         weighted fit where the sigma_icorresponds the weight         applied to the i-th data point.         Chi-Squared Measure: The value of the sum of         the above terms is referred to as the Chi-Squared measure.         Clearly the lower the absolute value of this measure the         better (globally) over the range of value the curve         selected fits the given data.               Using this class     In order to apply this class you must perform the     following steps:                       Set the Basis Functions: using         SetFunctionBasis         Fit the Function set to the Data: using         Boolean[]) or SetGeneralFitOrdered               Once the function has been fit you are able to `read''     the following quantitative information about the fitted     function:                       Return the value of Chi-Squared using         GetChiSquare         Return the coefficients in the function of best fit         using GetCoefficients         Evaluate the value of the function of best fit at a         given point using BestFitValue          </remarks>

            <summary>Non-linear function builder which builds up from component terms in an iterative fashion a wide variety of sets of non-linear functions.</summary>
            <remarks>    This approach to passing a non-linear function has the distinct     advantage in that it allows the user to pass functions by only     using primitive types.     Using this class     We illustrate the use of this class by providing the     following explicit example. In order to create an instance of     this class which represents a set of non-linear functions where     this set is defined as the set of functions which take the     following form:     f(x, a0, a1, a2,     a3, a4, a5) = a0     Sin (a1 x + a2) + a3 Sin     (a4 x + 2 + a5)     where a0, a1, a2,     a3l, a4, a5 can be any     real constants. Note that this determines a family of     non-linear functions because the term a0,     a1, a2, a3, a4,     a5, vary over the set of real numbers. Now in     order to set this family of non-linear functions to an instance     of this class you need to make the following method calls in     the following order:                       AddSineSum({ 1 }, { 1 },{ 0 }, { 1 }) -         Which sets the first Sine term: a0         Sin(a1 x + a2).         AddSineSum({ 1 }, { 1 },{ 2 }, { 1 })-         Which sets the second Sine term: a3         Sin(a4 x + 2 + a5).               In general the non-linear factor model consists of a     basis of functions f1, f2,...,     fn, which span the factor model, i.e. all     elements of the factor model can be represented as:     f1(x, a1,...., ap) +     f2(x, a'1,...., a'q) + ... +     fn(x, a''1,.....,     a''r)     where x and a1,..., ap,     a'1,..., a'q,..., a''1,...,     a''r are real variables (known as the model     parameters). Each of the individual terms are iteratively added     by calling one of the 'add...' methods contained within this     class.     Ordering of the Variables     Once the non-linear factor model has been built (using     this class) and fitted using the algorithm     NonLinearModel.getNonLinearModel, the values of the     ak's which generate the best fitting curve in     accordance with the least squares approach will be returned     within an array. The order of the terms of the array will be     determined to the order in which they where set. For example,     in the case of the regression model defined by the set of     functions which can be represented by:     f(x, a0, a1, a2,     a3, a4, a5) = a0     Sin (a1 x + a2) + a3 Sin     (a4 x + 2 + a5)     which is fitted using     NonLinearModel.getNonLinearModel, the array which is     returned will have a length of 6; where the first element of     the array will equal the fitted value of a0,     the second element of the array will equal the fitted value of     a1 and so on.</remarks>

            <summary>Adds a sum a Cosine functions as an element of the function basis.</summary>
            <remarks>    Please note that the k-th term of the sum which makes up the     basis function will take to form:     k-th Term = rk * a(3k) *     Cosnk (bk * a(3k+1)     * x + ck + a(3k+2)), (*)     where the Cosine function is in terms of radians, and     rk, nk, bk,     ck are real numbers which are given by the     parameters and a(3k), a(3k+1),     a(3k+2), are the variables which are to be     fitted. In order to construct the sum you just sum over     k starting from 0. That is, the term from which     the basis elements will be constructed is:     f(x, a0, ..., a2, ....,     a(3n+2)) = (sum of k of n-terms given by (*)     above),     where a0,....., a(3n+2) are     the model parameters of the function representing the     non-linear regression model which are to be fitted, and     x is the variable which will not be fitted.     Illustrative Example     In order to clarify the above explanation we provide an     explicit example of the use of this method. In order to set the     following sum of Cosine terms to an instance of the non-linear     factor model:     f(x, a0, a1, ..., a5)     = a0 * Cos2 (b0 *     a1 * x + a2) + a3 *     Cos1 (b1 * a4 * x + 2 +     a5),     you are required to pass the following parameters while     calling this method:                            coeCoeffs = { 1, 1 }         coefficients = { b0, b1         }         constants = { 0, 2 }         exponents = { 2, 1 }               Notes on the Radian measure     Radians are a means by which to describe the angle and     are related to the more commonly used degrees as follows:          360 degrees = 2 * Pi * radians          therefore, 1 radian = 180 / Pi degrees =     57.295... degrees.     Worked Example     We considered the function:     f(x, a0, a1, a2) = 1     a0 Cos1(1 a1 x + 0 +     a2),     which can be set to an instance of this class by calling     this method with the parameters:                            logCoeffs = { 1.0 }         coefficients = { 1.0 }         constants = { 0.0 }         exponents = { 1.0 }               Therefore, for example when we take { a0,     a1, a2 } = { 1, 1, 0 } or {     a0, a1, a2 } = { 2, 2, 2     }, and evaluate the derivative and function itself using     GetValueAt we find that:                                                                                      { 1, 1, 0 }                     { 1, 1, 0 }                     { 2, 2, 2 }                                                                            x = 0                     x = 3.1415..

In order to construct the sum you just sum over     k starting from 0.

Example     In order to clarify the above explanation we provide an     explicit example of the use of this method. In order to set the     following sum of Exponential terms to an instance of the     non-linear factor model:     f(x, a0, a1,...,a7) =     a0 * exp2 (b0 * a1     * x + a2) + a3 * exp(1)     (b1 * a4 * x + 2 +     a5),     you are required to pass the following parameters while     calling this method:                            expCoeffs = { 1, 1 }         coefficients = { b0, b1         }         constants = { 0, 2 }         exponents = { 2, 1 }               Remark: Within the QAClient Exponential for the     NonLinearModel class, we show that in fact you are able to     applied the non-linear curve fitting algorithm to a more     general family of exponential functions of the type: f(x,     a[0],a[1], a[2], a[3]) = r.a[0].(exp(b.a[1].x + c + a[2]))^(n +     a[3]), in particular where the power term contains the     model parameter a[3].     Worked Example     We considered the function:     f(x, a0, a1, a2) = 1     a0 exp1(1 a1 x + 0 +     a2),     which can be set to an instance of this class by calling     this method with the parameters:                            logCoeffs = { 1.0 }         coefficients = { 1.0 }         constants = { 0.0 }         exponents = { 1.0 }               Therefore, for example when { a0,     a1, a2 } = { 1, 1, 0 }, and evaluate     the derivative and function itself using GetValueAt we     find that:                                                                                      x = 1                     x = 2                     x = 3                     x = 4                                                       ∂f/∂a0 = exp(a1x +                     a2)                     2.718                     7.389                     20.085                     54.598                                                       ∂f/∂a1 =                     a0exp(a1x +                     a2)x                     2.718                     14.778                     60.257                     218.393                                                       ∂f/∂a2 =                     a0exp(a1x +                     a2)                     2.718                     7.389                     20.085                     54.598                                                       f(x, a0, a1,                     a2) = a0                     exp(a1 x + a2)                     2.718                     7.389                     20.085                     54.598                                                 Source Code Implementation: You can find the     source code implementation of this example within the     QAExample's within the Client/QAClients/ directory.

            <summary>Adds a sum of (natural) log functions to be used as basis elements.</summary>
            <remarks>    Where the k-th term of the sum which makes up the basis     function will take the form:     k-th Term = fk(x, a(3k),     a(3k+1), a(3k+2)) = rk *     a(3k) * (log(bk * a(3k+1) * x     + ck +     a(3k+1)))nk,     where the log function is in natural logarithm function     (i.e. base e), and rk, nk,     bk, ck are real numbers which are     given (as parameters) and a(3k),     a(3k+1), a(3k+2), are the (model)     variables which are to be fitted. In order to construct the sum     you just sum over k starting from 0. That is, the     term from which the basis elements will be constructed     is:     f(x, a0, ..., a2, ....,     a(3n+2)) = (sum of k of n-terms given by (*)     above),     where a0,....., a(3n+2) are     the variables of the function representing the non-linear     regression model which are to be fitted, and x is the     variable which will not be fitted.     Range over which the function and its derivatives is     properly defined     Care will need to be taken when applying this method     since the logarithm function considered above and its     derivatives are not defined for all values of x,     a0,...,a(3n+2). However, for a subset     of the entire range the function defined and its derivatives     are real valued functions. Here we will described to points at     which the logarithm function or its derivatives are not     properly defined functions and hence points for which the     method GetValueAt should not be called.     The logarithm considered above is only a properly defined     real valued function on the range where the arguement of the     logarithm function is positive. Moreover, since we cnosider a     sum of such logarithm functions the sum of the logarithm     functions is only properly defined when:     bk * a(3k+1) * x + ck     + a(3k+1) &gt; 0,     for all k. Simular remarks would also apply to the     derivative with respect to a(3k) of the     logarithm function defined above since:     ∂ fk/∂a(3k) =     rk.nk.log(bk *     a(3k+1) * x + ck +     a(3k+1))nk-1     In addition, the derivatives with respect to     a(3k+1), a(3k+2) only exit     when:     bk * a(3k+1) * x + ck     + a(3k+1) ≠ 0,     for all k.     Example     In order to clarify the above explanation we provide an     explicit example of the use of this method. In order to set the     following sum of Logarithm terms to an instance of the     non-linear factor model:     f(x, a0, a1, ..., a5)     = a0 * log2 (b0 *     a1 * x + a2) + a3 *     log1 (b1 * a4 * x + 2 +     a5),     you are required to pass the following parameters while     calling this method:                            logCoeffs = { 1, 1 }         coefficients = { b0, b1         }         constants = { 0, 2 }         exponents = { 2, 1 }               Worked Example     We considered the function:     f(x, a0, a1, a2) = 1     a0 log1(1 a1 x + 0 +     a2),     which can be set to an instance of this class by calling     this method with the parameters:                            logCoeffs = { 1.0 }         coefficients = { 1.0 }         constants = { 0.0 }         exponents = { 1.0 }               Therefore, for example when { a0,     a1, a2 } = { 1, 1, 0 }, and evaluate     the derivative and function itself using GetValueAt we     find that:                                                                                      x = 1                     x = 2                                                       ∂f/∂a0 = log(a1x +                     a2)                     0                     0.6931                                                       ∂f/∂a1 =                     a0(a1x +                     a2)-1x                     1                     1                                                       ∂f/∂a2 =                     a0(a1x +                     a2)-1                     1                     0.5                                                       f(x, a0, a1,                     a2) = a0                     log(a1 x + a2)                     0                     0.6931                                                 Source Code Implementation: You can find the     source code implementation of this example within the     QAExample's within the Client/QAClients/ directory.

            <summary>Adds a sum of power terms as an element of the function basis.</summary>
            <remarks>    The sum of power terms will take the follow form:     f(x, a0, a1, a2,...,     a3n+2) = (r0 * a0 *     (a1 * b0 * x + c0 +     a2)p0) + ... + (rn     * a3n * (a3n+1 * bb * x +     cn +     a3n+2)pn),     where r0,..., rn,     b0,..., bn, c0,...,     cn, p0,..., pn are     arbitrary real numbers, a0,...,     a3n+2 are real numbers corresponding to values     of the model parameters and x is a real variable.     Remark: The sum of power terms for the non-linear     factor model is a direct generalization of the sum of power     terms contained within the General Linear Factor model (see     GeneralLinearFactorModel).     Example     In order to clarify the use of this method we provide the     following explicit example. In order to set the following term     to an instance of the non-linear factor model:     f(x, a0, a1, a2) = 2     * a0 * (a1 * 1 * x + a2 +     0)3,     you must make a call to this method with the     parameters:                       powerCoefficients = {2}         coefficients = {1}         constants = {0}         exponents = {3}               Using this method to represent a constant function     term     You are able to represent the constant function     term:     f(x, a0) = a0 *     constant,     by calling this method with the parameters constant,     coefficients being an array of length 1, where the elements     can take any (non-zero) value and powerCoefficients =     {constant}, exponents = {0}. However in such an instance     care must be taken to observe that in fact you are representing     the constant functions using the sum of power terms convension     in which:     f(x, a0, a1, a2) =     constant * a1 (a1 * x +     a2)0 = constant *     a1     In particular, you will need to keep track of the model     parameters a1 and a2 above     when calling methods such as GetValueAt, in which you     will need to provide (in fact any) values for     a1 and a2.     Worked Example     We considered the function:     f(x, a0, a1,..., a8)     = a0(a1x + a2) +     a3(a4x + a5)2 +     (2.5)a6(a7a0 +     a8)0,     which can be set to an instance of this class by calling     this method with the parameters:                            logCoeffs = { 1.0, 1.0, 2.5 }         coefficients = { 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 }         constants = { 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 }         exponents = { 1.0, 2.0, 0.0 }               Therefore, for example when { a0,     a1, ..., a8 } = { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1     }, and evaluate the derivative and function itself using     GetValueAt we find that:                                                                                      x = 0                     x = 1                     x = 2                                                       ∂f/∂a0 = a0x +                     a1                     1                     2                     3                                                       ∂f/∂a1 =                     a0x                     0                     1                     2                                                       ∂f/∂a2 =                     a0                     1                     1                     1                                                       ∂f/∂a3 = (a4x +                     a5)2                     1                     4                     9                                                       ∂f/∂a4 = 2                     a3(a4x +                     a5)x                     0                     4                     12                                                       ∂f/∂a5 =                     2a3(a4x +                     a5)                     2                     4                     6                                                       ∂f/∂a6 = 2.5                     2.5                     2.5                     2.5                                                       ∂f/∂a7 = 0                     0                     0                     0                                                       ∂f/∂a8 = 0                     0                     0                     0                                                       f                     4.5                     8.5                     14.5                                                 Source Code Implementation: You can find the     source code implementation of this example within the     QAExample's within the Client/QAClients/ directory.

            <remarks>    Further Explanation     Recall that in general the non-linear factor model     consists of a basis of functions f1,     f2,..., fn, which span the factor     model, i.e. any element of the factor model can be represented     as:     f(x, a1,...,as) =     f1(x, a0,...., a3p+2) +     f2(x, a'0,...., a'3q+2) + ...     + fn(x, a''0,.....,     a''3r+2)     where x is the real space variable and     a0,..., a3p+2, a'0,...,     a'3q+2,..., a''0,...,     a''3r+2 are known as the model parameters which     are real variables of the function. Recall, that each of the     individual terms are iteratively added by calling one of the     'add...' methods contained within this class.     The array returned by this methods has a length     s+1, where s is the numbe of the model parameters     within the non-linear function which has been set. The 1-st to     s-th terms of the returned array consists of the gradients of     the set function f(x, a1,...,as)     with respect to the model parameters a1 to     as respectively, evaluated at the point x     = evaluationPoint, and where the k-th model parameter is     equal to modelParameters[k] (which are each givenh as     parameters). The final s+1 element of the returned array     is equal to the value of the non-linear function set namely,     f(x, a1,...,as), evaluated at the     point x = evaluationPoint, where the k-th model     parameter is equal to modelParameters[k] (which are each     given as parameters). In mathemtical notation the returned     array is:          (∂f/∂a1,....,∂f/∂as,f),     where f = f(x, a1,...,as)     defined above and each of the terms of the array are evaluated     at a given point x = evaluationPoint (given as a     parameter), and for a set of model parameter equal to     modelParameters[k] (which is also given as a     parameter).</remarks>
            <returns>An array of length equal to the number of model parameters plus one (say s+1) used within the non-linear function set. Where the 1-st to s-st elements of the array are the gradients of the set function with respect to the 1-st to s-th model parameters and the s+1-th term is teh value of the function itself, where each of these terms are evaluated for a given value of the space variable (x) and set a given model parameters (both given as parameters).</returns>

            <summary>Non-linear regression using Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm after which ANNOVA type analysis can be performed.</summary>
            <remarks>    Regression Algorithm and its use     We provide the Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm by     which the non-linear function can be fitted to an experimental     data set in accordance with the least squares approach. That     is, the least squares (of the residuals) is taken to be the     maximum likelihood estimator. Before you are able to call the     main fitting algorithm GetNonLinearModel you are     required to have set the non-linear regression model using     SetNonLinearFunctionBasis. After you have set the     non-linear regression model you are able to call the non-linear     algorithm which will return the fitted model parameters. Once     the regression model has been fitted you will be able to     evaluate the following (in addition the ANNOVA type analysis     which we detail in the next section):                            BestFitValue - The value of the fitted         regression function at a given evaluation point.         GetChiSquare()- The value of the Chi-Squared         measure of the non-linear regression considered.         GetCovar()- The covariance matrix for the         non-linear regression model considered.         GetAlpha()- The linearized fitting matrix for         the non-linear regression model considered.               ANNOVA Analysis of the Regression model     ANNOVA is an abbreviation for the Analysis of the     Variance. This analysis provides information on the structure     of the variability of the regression model which form the basis     of many tests of the significance of a model. Note that in     order to be able to perform this statistical testing we make     certain assumptions about the errors associated with each of     the data points within the regression model (Y = F(X,a[]) +     error), namely:                       The Errors associated which each of the data points         are independent.         The Errors are normally distributed.         The Errors have a mean of zero.         The Errors have a constant variance.               Though from a theoretical point on view it is necessary     to make these assumptions in many practical instances these     assumptions will just not hold. Therefore, the user should take     this into account when ever apply ANNOVA type analysis to real     world situations. The order to see the degree to which these     assumptions are met a scatter plot of the residuals (evaluated     using GetResiduals) of the regression model should be     considered. The scatter plot will also provide a quick means by     which you are able to discover whether the particular     regression model considered was a good choice. If the     considered model is deemed not to have been a good choice then     further visual inspection of the scatter plot with in most     cases suggest possible refinements of the original model     considered.     Using Scatter Plots     Within a scatter plot of the residuals of a regression     model you should observe the following:                                         Testing the ANNOVA Assumptions                              If the residuals are independent and normally                 distributed then there will be no bunching and the                 density of points will increase as you get nearer                 to the zero value on the axis corresponding to the                 residuals values.                 If the residuals have a mean of zero then the                 scatter plot with be equally dispersed above and                 below zero on the residuals value axis.                 If the variance of the errors is constant then                 there will be no discernable change in the                 level of the dispersion for differing values of the                 model's (space) variable (i.e. x). In                 practical, you will often find that as the model's                 (space) variable increases the level of dispersion                 increase, that is, the variance increases.                                            Implications concerning the Regression Model itself                              If the residuals within the scatter plot are                 linearly increasing or descreasing with the model's                 (space) variable then it would imply that the                 regression model itself should be modified by                 including another linear term which would rectify                 this linear trend.                 If the residuals within the scatter plot are                 trending in a discernable yet non-linear fashion                 with the model's (space) variable then a                 corresponding term rectifying this trend should be                 added to the regression model. For example, if the                 residuals are cyclical then you will need to add a                 sine or cosine type term (or another term with a                 cyclical nature); similarly if the residuals are                 first increasing then decreases (or vice versa)                 then you may need to add a quadratic term and so                 on.                                     In some instances it may be possible to transform a     non-linear regression model into a linear regression model     using a non-linear transformation of the experimental data set.     In such instances you should map the given problem into its     associated (linear) problem which can be effectively modeled     using a linear regression model with the class     GeneralLinear.     ANNOVA Functionality Offered     Within this class once the regression model has been     fitted you are able to evaluate the following statistical     ANNOVA type measures:                                         Measures of the Regression Function's 'distance from'                              GetResiduals() - The residuals of the                 non-lniear regression model.                 SumSquaresError()- The sum of the                 squares due to error (often referred to as                 SSE).                 MeanSquaresError - The mean square due to error                 (MSE).                 StandardError - The Standard Error of the                 Estimate.                 TotalSumSquares - The Total Sum of Squares                 (SST).                 SumSquaresRegression - The Sum of Squares Due                 to Regression (SSR).                 MeanSquaresRegression - The mean square due to                 regression (MSR).                                            Measures of the Significance of the Model                              RSquared - The multiple R2 (or                 multiple coefficient of determination).                 RSquaredAdjusted - The Adjusted R2                 (or Adjusted Multiple Coefficient of                 Determination).                 FTest - The F-Test Statistic.                                     Worked Example     Within this worked example we illustrate the application     of the NonLinearModel class to fit the non-linear     function:     f(x, a[0],a[1]) = a[0].x +     a[1].x2,     against the data set:                                                                 x                     y                     sigma                                                       1.0                     1.0                     0.1                                                       2.0                     4.0                     0.1                                                       3.0                     9.0                     0.1                                                       4.0                     16.5                     0.1                                                 Where x in the independent variable and y     is the dependent variable. The sigma corresponds to the     measurement Note that since we set each sigma to take     the same value then the Boolean[]) and then perform ANNOVA type     analysis of thisfit.</remarks>

            <remarks>    Further Details     The F-Test Statistic is used within the F-Test which is     used to determine whether there is a significant relationship     between the dependent variables (i.e. the data set) and the set     of independent variables. In particular, the F-Test tests the     null hypothesis which states that for the model parameters     (a[i]'s) of the regression model we have:     a[1] = a[2] = ... = a[n] = 0,     where n is the number of model parameters, and the     alternative hypothesis states that at least one of the model     parameters a[j] ≠ 0, for some j. When the T-Test     Statistic is large then it supports the view that the null     hypothesis can be rejected.

            <remarks>    The Chi-Square is a convenient measure of how well (globally)     over the range considered the function of best fit, fits the     data considered. Note that before the Chi-Squares can be     evaluated the set function must first be fitted using     GetNonLinearModel.     Remark: Roughly speaking for an unweighted     function of best fit, the square root of the Chi-Squared     measure is the average distance in the y-direction from a data     point to the curve of best fit.     What is Chi-Squared?     Recall that here we are finding the curve of best fit in     accordance with minimizing the sum of the squares of the     terms:     ( yi - f(x, a1,     a2,...,an)) /     sigmai,     where we sum over the i, for 1 &lt;= i &lt;=     n; the (xi, yi) are the data     points, f(x, a1,     a2,...,an) is the non-linear function     which is to be fitted using GetNonLinearModel and     sigmai is a constant associated with the     significance of the i-th observation (ie i-th data point)     within the experimental data set. The Chi-Squared     measure is precisely the value of this sum.     Remark: In the case of an experiemental data set     the constant sigmai is generally taken to be     the standard deviations of the measurement error of the values     of yi. Recall that the measurment errors     associated with an sequence of experiments can be evaluated     using MeasurementErrors.

            <remarks>    That is, for a non-linear function f(x,     a1,...,an), of one real variable     x and model parameters a[] = {     a1,...,an}), we find the model     variables such that the Chi-squared measure:          Chi squared = Sumk {(y[k] - f(x[k],a[])) / s[k]     }2     is minimal, where:                       x[] - are the domain points, i.e. the points         at which the values of the real variable at which the         function are evaluated.         y[]- are the values of the data points at the         domain points.         a[]- the model parameters which are fitted for         the data set considered, namely (x[k], y[k]).         s[]- are the measurement errors (or standard         deviation) of the data points y[]. That is,         s[k]is the measurement error of the k-th data point         y[k]. Note that the measurement error of the k-th         data point is provided as the k-th element of the parameter         measurementError. For further details please see the         notes provided below.         Sumk- Signifies that the above         expression is summed over all k.               Features of the Algorithm     The Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm for the non-linear     framework finds the local minimum in accordance with the least     squares approach. This mean that the initial point given (i.e.     initial model parameters) from which the minimum is sort lies     within the same basin of attraction of the global minimum. In     practice, this means in particularly when a non-linear function     with many terms is considered that the initial starting point     should be very carefully chosen. This is not a consequence of     our implementation but the nature of the algorithm and problem     at hand. In particular, the Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm is     of greedy type and essentially uses an abstraction of calculus     based methods in which the best point in a neighborhood of a     point is chosen at each step.     Remark: As a side note, the linear algorithm as     offered within GeneralLinear is based on a simplex algorithm     which is combinatorial in nature and therefore is almost     certain to converge to the global best fit and quickly.     However, the nature of the general non-linear case means that     non-combinatorial methods must be used. Here we use what is     generally refered to as greedy type algorithms which are based     on techniques derived from differential calculus.     Selecting the Initial Point     The Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm ability to find the     solution to a non-linear regression problem depends critically     on the intial parameters at which the search for the curve of     best fit is started. Moreover, the more degrees of freedom the     greater the dependence on the initial parameters since     generally speaking the greater the number of basis of     attraction within the solution space.     As a general reference you should find that the algorithm     is not unduly sensitive to the initial parameters for a one     factor functions (for example f(x, a1,     a2) = a1 Sin (a2.x)), but     in our testing when many factors are used because such     functions have many basins of attraction, and there structure     is generally rather complex and non-obvious, the initial     parameters will need to be selected by the user very     carefully.     Measurement Errors, Weighted Best Fit and the Sigma     Parameter     For a general over-view of measurement errors we refer     the reader to the documentation of the class MeasurementErrors.     Here we describe three differings interpretations of the     parameter sigma which allows the regression model     offered by this methods to be interpretationed in three     different ways:                       Standard Best Fit: If you do not wish to take         the measurement errors or weight the data points then all         the elements of the parameter array sigma can be set         to the same strictly positive value, say 0.1. Note         that the value given for the measurement errors cannot be         set to zero since it would imply an element of the         Chi-squared measure involving division by zero.         Measurement Errors: You are able to find the         greatest likelihood coefficients when the measurement         errors (i.e. the standard deviations of the errors of the         observations in the yi's) are taken into         account. In order to fit the function taking into account         the measurement errors you are required to provide the k-th         term of the parameter sigmafor the measurement error         of the yk(i.e. the value of the y-axis         coordinate of the k-th data point) which is then used         within the fitting of the function. Note that all the         measurement errors must be strictly positive         numbers.         Weighted Best Fit: If you wish you are also         able to apply this class with the view of finding the best         weighted fit where the         1/sigmaicorresponds to the (relative)         weight applied to the i-th data point. That is, as         sigmaiincrease the data point is given a         correspondingly lower weight.               Note: Within the class MeasurementErrors we offer     the auxiliary method MeasurementError which evaluates     the measurement error of a collection of measurements of an     experiment in the same state.     Effect of Differing Measurement Errors     In the table below we illustrate the effect the various     combinations of measurement error sets. This table displays the     results of fitting the non-linear function:     f(1) = a0 * x + a1 *     x2,     to four data points with corresponding parameter     sets:                            x = { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 }         y = { 1.0, 4.0, 9.0, 16.5 }               Where the corresponding measurement error of each of     these four data elements is sig1,     sig2, sig3, sig4,     respectively.                                                                 sig1                     sig2                     sig3                     sig4                     a0                     a1                                                       0.1                     0.1                     0.1                     0.1                     -0.1483                     1.0645                                                       0.1                     0.1                     0.1                     1                     -0.0112                     1.049                                                       1                     1                     0.1                     0.1                     -0.3646                     1.1225                                            </remarks>

If     the value of the element is false the value of the     corresponding element from the initialCoefficients array     will remain unchanged during the entire evolution of the     algorithm.     Example: Say we have the following     function:     f(x) = a1 *x + a2 *     x2,     where a1, a2 are the     coefficient. We assume that we already determined that     variables has the value -1 but we want to     determine the value of a2. In this case the     ia array will be {false, true} which means that the     coefficient a1 will be fixed and the     coefficient a2 will vary during the evolution     of algorithm..</param>

Moreover, the statistics can be viewed as the proportion of the     variability in the dependent variable that can be explained by     the multiple regression equation (see example below). The     multiple R2 will lie within the interval     [0,1], where the closer to 1 the meaure is the     better the predictive ability of the model.     Example     If the multiple linear regression equation represents the     time taken to complete a bus route where the model has two     variables: the length (in kms) of the bus route and the number     of stops on the route. If the multiple R2 of this     regression equation is 0.95, then it means that     95 percentage of the variability of the travel time to     complete a route is explained by the estimated multiple     regression equation with the length of the bus route and number     of stops as the independent variables.

For     example, deciding if or if not an additional variable is     statistically significant for a model the (traditional)     R2 measure (see RSquared) can lead to     misleading results since in all cases the measure will     increase. Therefore, in order to guard against over-estimating     the effect of adding additional variables to a model the     Adjusted R2 was introduced.     When R2 is small and the number of Variables is     large     In the case when R2 is small and the number of     variables is large the Adjusted R2 can be negative.

            <summary>Represents an axis drawn on a ChartArea.</summary>
            <remarks>    The axis object is a powerful class that does the following.              Defines objects used to draw the axis and fill         sections of a ChartArea such as grid lines.         Facilitates tick label text formatting and numerous         manipulation mechanisms.         Defines data element layout and order.         Defines an axis dotnetCHARTING.Scale, range, and tick         frequency.         Calculates copies of itself that can perform unit         conversions between over one thousand defined units, mark         time ranges with a specified TimeInterval, and manipulate         each tick label with a specified custom method.     Axes can behave in 3 different modes.                           Mode             Description                               Value Axis             The value axis dynamically displays a             numeric or DateTime range. Properties such as Scale,             Interval, TimeInterval and others that relate to ranges             apply to this type of axis. Using ChartType.Combo, the             y axis is a value axis, with ChartType.Horizontal the x             axis is.                               Label Axis             The label axis does not display a range of             values but rather the names of elements or series.             Using ChartType.Combo, the x axis is a label axis and             with ChartType.Horizontal the y axis is. Using the             DataEngine with DataEngine.DateGrouping generates             elements with a numeric value in Element.YValue and a             DateTime value in Element.XDateTime. Because the Combo             chart's x axis is a label axis the date time value             cannot be shown. To remedy this, the DataEngine also             populates each element's Name property with a string             representation of the DateTime value. This allows the x             axis to show date values but it does not allow the use             of advanced options such as setting the TimeInterval             for those dates. To expose this functionality             ChartType.Scatter must be used because the x axis for             that chart type acts as a value axis.                               Calculated Axis             A calculated or shadow axis is created by             using of the Axis.Calculate methods and must be added             to the Chart.AxisCollection collection. It is drawn by             the original axis and represents the same range but             displays it in a different way.              </remarks>

Attach to element         An AxisMarker is instantiated and passed to the AxisMarker         property of any element.

Options include Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months, Quarters and Years where any StartDate and EndDate can be used and the chart will show all values sequentially. There are additional options for Hour/Minute, Day/Hour, Week/Day, Month/Day, Year/Quarter and Year/Month in these cases there are 2 special considerations 1) only a single day / week / month / or year is charted and 2) if the date range is greater than the period type (e.g. 1 day / 1 week / 1 month / 1 year) values are totalled over that period. There are also shortcuts for the grouping cases of Hour (Hours/Minute), Day (Day/Hour), Week(Week/Day), Month (Month/Day) and Year (Year/Month). See all time interval options. This feature automatically groups multiple data points over a given date range into the specific date grouping you select.

            <remarks>.netCHARTING supports streaming images in addition to returning a reference to a generated file. There are differences in the way the control can be used between these two image return methods. When using a file reference, you are free to treat the page as you normally would, including HTML and any other web content on the page.    If you are streaming the image back, only the control call should exist on the page because no other HTML will render. This is not a limitation of .netCHARTING but rather specific to the HTTP implementation which serves each request separately (as such a request to a web site with 3 images is actually 4 unique requests and the browser does the job of assembling those 4 items into the web page you see.    Becauase streaming images does not allow HTML, setting url and tooltip properties of elements on the chart will have no effect.</remarks>

Options include Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months, Quarters and Years where any StartDate and EndDate can be used and the chart will show all values sequentially. There are additional options for Hour/Minute, Day/Hour, Week/Day, Month/Day, Year/Quarter and Year/Month in these cases there are 2 special considerations 1) only a single day / week / month / or year is charted and 2) if the date range is greater than the period type (e.g. 1 day / 1 week / 1 month / 1 year) values are totalled over that period. There are also shortcuts for the grouping cases of Hour (Hours/Minute), Day (Day/Hour), Week(Week/Day), Month (Month/Day) and Year (Year/Month). See all time interval options. This feature automatically groups multiple data points over a given date range into the specific date grouping you select. When DateGrouping is enabled you must ensure that each series within a given chart returns date/time data for the second column returned by the SqlStatement.</remarks>

            <summary>Evaluates the accumulation/distribution indicator for each of the (sub)collection of periods of a given length.</summary>
            <remarks>    The accumulation/distribution indicator illustrates the     degree to which an asset is being accumulated or distributed by     the market over each of these collection of periods. The     indicator uses the closing price's proximity to the high or low     over the period to determine if accumulation or reduction is     taking place in the market. The proximity measure if then     multiplied by the volume over the period in order to give more     weight to moves with correspondingly higher volume.     Interpretation     A divergence between the price action and the     AccumulationDistribution indicator can signal that a trend is     nearing completion, a trends continuation and break-outs from     trading ranges. The actual value of this indicator is of no     significance, what is significant is its change in value     relative to the previous periods which can warn of a possible     break-out during a trading range (falling/rising indicator),     the continuation of a trend (higher highs in uptrend, or lower     lows in downtrend) or a change/completion of a trend     (divergence between the price action and the direction of the     indicator).     Example     Say for example we know that:                       Highs = {3, 4, 3, 4, 5} (i.e. 3 is the latest         high)         Lows = {2, 1, 2, 1, 3}(i.e. 2 is the latest         low)         Volume = {300, 290, 295, 285, 290}(i.e. 300 is         the volume in the latest period.               Now if the lengthOfPeriod considered is 4, then     this method will return an array of length two where the first     term is the accumulation\distribution indicator (evaluated     using AccumulationDistribution(string, Series)) when:                       Highs = {3, 4, 3, 4} (i.e. above highs with         last element removed)         Lows = {2, 1, 2, 1}(i.e. above highs with last         element removed)         Volume = {300, 290, 295, 285}(i.e. above highs         with last element removed)     and the second term is the accumulation/distribution     indicator when:                       Highs = {4, 3, 4, 5} (i.e. the window moves         one position back)         Lows = {1, 2, 1, 3}(i.e. the window moves one         position back)         Volume = {290, 295, 285, 290}(i.e. the window         moves one position back)          </remarks>

Now if the lengthOfPeriod considered is 4, then     this method will return an array of length two where the first     term is the accumulation\distribution indicator (evaluated     using AccumulationDistribution) when:                       Highs = {3, 4, 3, 4} (i.e. above highs with         last element removed)         Lows = {2, 1, 2, 1}(i.e. above highs with last         element removed)         Volume = {300, 290, 295, 285}(i.e. above highs         with last element removed)     and the second term is the accumulation/distribution     indicator when:                       Highs = {4, 3, 4, 5} (i.e. the window moves         one position back)         Lows = {1, 2, 1, 3}(i.e. the window moves one         position back)         Volume = {290, 295, 285, 290}(i.e. the window         moves one position back)          </remarks>

            <summary>Evaluates the accumulation/distribution indicator for each of the (sub)collection of periods of a given length.</summary>
            <remarks>    The accumulation/distribution indicator illustrates the     degree to which an asset is being accumulated or distributed by     the market over each of these collection of periods. The     indicator uses the closing price's proximity to the high or low     over the period to determine if accumulation or reduction is     taking place in the market. The proximity measure if then     multiplied by the volume over the period in order to give more     weight to moves with correspondingly higher volume.     Interpretation     A divergence between the price action and the     AccumulationDistribution indicator can signal that a trend is     nearing completion, a trends continuation and break-outs from     trading ranges. The actual value of this indicator is of no     significance, what is significant is its change in value     relative to the previous periods which can warn of a possible     break-out during a trading range (falling/rising indicator),     the continuation of a trend (higher highs in uptrend, or lower     lows in downtrend) or a change/completion of a trend     (divergence between the price action and the direction of the     indicator).     Example     Say for example we know that:                       Highs = {3, 4, 3, 4, 5} (i.e. 3 is the latest         high)         Lows = {2, 1, 2, 1, 3}(i.e. 2 is the latest         low)         Volume = {300, 290, 295, 285, 290}(i.e. 300 is         the volume in the latest period.               Now if the lengthOfPeriod considered is 4, then     this method will return an array of length two where the first     term is the accumulation\distribution indicator (evaluated     using AccumulationDistribution) when:                       Highs = {3, 4, 3, 4} (i.e. above highs with         last element removed)         Lows = {2, 1, 2, 1}(i.e. above highs with last         element removed)         Volume = {300, 290, 295, 285}(i.e. above highs         with last element removed)     and the second term is the accumulation/distribution     indicator when:                       Highs = {4, 3, 4, 5} (i.e. the window moves         one position back)         Lows = {1, 2, 1, 3}(i.e. the window moves one         position back)         Volume = {290, 295, 285, 290}(i.e. the window         moves one position back)          </remarks>

Details of Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)     Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is a volume weighted average of     Accumulation/Distribution over a specified period, which is     usually taken to be 21 days. The CMF offers a volume weighted     indicator on the following two principles:                       The nearer the close is to the high the more         accumulation is taking place.         The nearer the close is to the low the more         distribution is taking place.               Evaluation     The CMF indicator is evaluated for the following     steps:                       Evaluate the Volume Weighted         Accumulation/Distribution over each of the days within the         period considered for the calculation.

Evaluation     The CMF indicator is evaluated for the following     steps:                       Evaluate the Volume Weighted         Accumulation/Distribution over each of the days within the         period considered for the calculation. The Volume Weighted         Accumulation/Distribution on each day is given by:                  (((Close - Low)-(High - Close))/(High - Low)) *         Volume         Sum the Volume Weighted Accumulation/Distribution         over the period and the divide the result by the sum of the         volume over the period.               Example of Application     Within this example we illustrate the way this method     works when we consider a given 10 period in which the length of     period over which the CHM is evaluated is 4. In this case the     result will be an array of 7 elements as follows:                       result[0]: CMF calculated over the last four         periods         result[1]: CMF calculated over previous four         periods         ...         result[7]: CMF calculated using the periods between         the earliest period and the fourth from earliest         period.          </remarks>

            <remarks>    The CCI measures the variation of a security's price from its     statistical mean. High values show that prices are unusually     high compared to average prices whereas low values indicate     that prices are unusually low. The CCI can be used effectively     on any type of security, but clearly it is most applicable     where the security has should a strong degree on mean     reversion.     Lambert originally commended that the CCI was designed to     capture the trade cycle (i.e. low-to-low or high-to-high) turns     in commodity markets. The system assumes that commodities move     in cycles and uses 1/3 of the cycle period for the evaluation     of the CCI. We allow the uses to specify the length of the     calculation period used but we advise that you take the     calculation cycle to be approximately one third of your     estimate for the length of the trade cycle.     Calculation Period: the number of days used in the     evaluation of the CCI. In Donald Lambert's original system this     was taken to be one third of the estimate length of the trade     cycle.     Remark: Within the evaluation procedure (step 2),     we multiply the result by the constant 0.015. The constant was     originally used in Lambert's system and has been found to     ensure that around 70-80 percent of all the values given by the     CCI lie the range [-100,+100]. Hence, the constant is just used     to calibrate the indicator with respect to the range [-100,     +100].     Interpretation     Significant signals are generated when either the CCI starts to     diverge from the price action which will signify a correlation     in the price, or when the CCI extended (typically above 100 or     below -100) which indicates oversold or over brought     conditions.     Further details concerning the CCI can be found in an     article by Donald Lambert that appeared in the October 1980     issue of Commodities (now known as Futures) Magazine.              Evaluation Procedure         We summaries our basic evaluation procedure by the         following three steps:                      First evaluate the simple moving average (SMA) of             the Typical Price Indicator (see Filters) over the             calculation period.             Evaluate the SMA over the calculation period of the             absolute value on each on the calculation period days             between the Typical Price on that day and the SMA found             in step 1 above, and multiply the result by 0.015.             Divide todays typical price minus the SMA of the             typical price found in step 1, by the result given by             step 2.                                            </remarks>

Evaluation     The Directional Movement Indicator can be summarized by     the following formula:     Directional Movement Indicator = 100 * ( (PDM - MDM) /     (PDM + MDM) ),     where PDM is the Plus Directional Movement (PDM)     indicator over the last two trading periods which can be     evaluated using PlusDirectionalMovement and MDM     is the Minus Directional Movement (MDM) indicator over the last     two trading periods which can be evaluated using     MinusDirectionalMovement.     Interpretation     The directional indicator has a range of [0,100],     where to higher the value returned the stronger the trend is     said to be. If a trend is reliable then the smoothed     directional lines (PDM and MDM) will diverge and the indicator     will increase.

            <remarks>    Evaluation     The formula for the calculation of MFI is:     MFI = (high - low)/volume     where high is the highest traded price during the     period, low is the lowest traded price during the period     and, volume is the overall volume traded on that     period.     Interpretation     There are four types of trading sessions called:                       Fakes - volume is low but MFI is rising         Fades - both volume and MFI is down (the price might         move in the opposite direction)         Squats - the volume is up, MFI is down         Greens - when the MFI and volume are up which         represent a strong signal to follow the trendline          </remarks>

Remark: This indicator is particularly appropriate     for traded assets where the opening and closing prices are     unreliable.

Hence     for the FTSE market the quoted market price at the beginning     and end of the market may not be indicative of where a given     stock is trading within a given period.

            <remarks>    The MFI is related to the Directional Movement Indicator of     Wellas Wilder, but the MFI system also takes into account the     volume as well as the price action.     Interpretation     Divergence of the indicator within a continuing trend     indicates that a reversal is imminent. The MFI also is a good     means to signal market tops and bottoms. A reasonable rule is a     market top is given more significance when the MFI is above     80 and a market bottom is given more significance when     the MFI is below 20.     Evaluation              The Money Flow Index (MFI) is evaluated over a given user         defined number of trading periods. The evaluation of the         MFI follows the below steps:                      Evaluates the Money Flow on each day. The Money             Flow is the product of the Typical Value Indicator (see             Filters) for that day and the volume.             Each day is either classified as either a Positive             Money Flow day, Negative Money Flow day or no Flow day.             If the typical price increases then the day is a said             to be a Positive Money Day, if it decreasing then it is             said to be a negative money day and if it stays then             same then it is said the be a no flow day.             The Positive Money and Negative Money Flow's are             calculated by summing the Money Flow over the Positive             Money Flow Days or the Negative Money Flow days             respectively.             The Money Flow Index (MFI) is evaluated by dividing             the Positive Money Flow by the Negative Money Flow.                                            </remarks>

The 25-th, 50-th, 75-th         percentiles are often referred to as the 1-st,         2-nd (median) and 3-rd quartile respectively.

            <summary>Fits a polynomial of a given degree to a data set in accordance with the least squares approach and returns the value of the fitted function over an extended (i.e. above, below or both) range of the x-coordinate values of the given data set.</summary>
            <remarks>    For example, if we fit a polynomial of degree 2, then we fit     the quadratic polynomial (i.e. f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2);     similarly if we fit a polynomial of degree 3, then we fit the     cubic polynomial (i.e. f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3).     Remark: The difference between this method and     Int32), is that it allows the values of the fitted function to     be evaluated over an extended range. That is, a range in the     x-coordinate greater than the original given data set.     Where the extended values are evaluated?     The parameters step, forward,     backward allows the position and number of additional     points above and/or below the range of the values in the     x-coordinate of the original data set to be given. The     forward parameter specifies the number of the additional     evaluation points of the fitted function which are greater than     the values of the x-coordinates of the original data set.     Similarly, the backward parameter specifies the number     of the additional evaluation points of the fitted function     which are lower than the values of the x-coordinates of the     original data set. The step specifies the distance in     the x-coordinate between each of the additional data points,     where the first additional data point either above or below is     exactly a distance of step from the points of the     original data set which the highest and lowest values in the     x-coordinate.     For example, consider the data set x = 1, 2, 3;     y = 1, 2, 3. Now if step = 1, forward = 2,     and backward = 3, then this method when applied will     return a two dimensional array. This two dimensional array will     have the following structure: { { -2, f(-2) } { -1, f(-1) }     { 0, f(0) }{ 1, 1 } { 2, 2 }{ 3, 3 } { 4, f(4) } { 5, f(5) }     }, where f(-2), f(-1), f(0), f(4), f(5) correspond     to the value of the fitted functions at the points x = -2,     -1, 0, 4, 5, respectively.</remarks>

            <summary>Evaluates the greatest likelyhood coefficients of the function of best fit in accordance with the least squares approach for the function basis given.</summary>
            <remarks>    Further Details     In its simplest case this method given a data set     (x_i, y_i), for i=0, ..., m, are are able to find     the coefficients a_1, ..., a_n such that the     function:     f(x) = a_1 * f_1(x) + a_2 * f_2 + ... + x_n *     f_n(x)     where f_1,...f_n are the function basis set using     SetFunctionBasis method, and the function f(x), is best     fit in accordance with the least square approach. That is,     coefficients are selected such the points (x_i, f(x_i)),     for i=1,...,m; are a best fit for the given data set     (x_i, y_i), i=1,...,m.     Fixing some Coefficients     Please note that within this implementation we reserve     the right to fix some of the coefficients before the function     is fitted. In such instances the above described fitting is     performed with some of the coefficients fixed to the initial     value which they are given. The fit parameter is used in     order to determine which (if any) of the coefficient are kept     fixed during the fitting.     Measure Errors or Weighted Best Fit     In addition as mentioned within the overview of this     class you are able to incorporate one of the following features     when determining the greatest likelyhood coefficients:                       Measure Error: You are able to find the         greatest likelyhood coefficients when the measure error         (i.e. the standard deviations of the errors of the         observation so the y_i's). In order to fit the         function taking into account the measurment error you are         required to provide the k-th term of the parameter         sigma as the measurement error of the         y_k(i.e. the value of the y-axis corrdinate of the         k-th data point which in used within the fitting of the         function.         Weighted Best Fit: If you wish you are also         able to apply this class with the view of finding the best         weighted fit where the sigma_icorresponds the weight         applied to the i-th data point.          </remarks>

            <summary>Adds a sum of power terms as an element of the function basis.</summary>
            <remarks>    The sum of power terms will take the follow form:     f(x, a0, a1, a2,...,     a3n+2) = (r0 * a0 *     (a1 * b0 * x + c0 +     a2)p0) + ... + (rn     * a3n * (a3n+1 * bb * x +     cn +     a3n+2)pn),     where r0,..., rn,     b0,..., bn, c0,...,     cn, p0,..., pn are     arbitrary real numbers, a0,...,     a3n+2 are real numbers corresponding to values     of the model parameters and x is a real variable.     Remark: The sum of power terms for the non-linear     factor model is a direct generalization of the sum of power     terms contained within the General Linear Factor model (see     GeneralLinearFactorModel).     Example     In order to clarify the use of this method we provide the     following explicit example. In order to set the following term     to an instance of the non-linear factor model:     f(x, a0, a1, a2) = 2     * a0 * (a1 * 1 * x + a2 +     0)3,     you must make a call to this method with the     parameters:                       powerCoefficients = {2}         coefficients = {1}         constants = {0}         exponents = {3}               Using this method to represent a constant function     term     You are able to represent the constant function     term:     f(x, a0) = a0 *     constant,     by calling this method with the parameters constant,     coefficients being an array of length 1, where the elements     can take any (non-zero) value and powerCoefficients =     {constant}, exponents = {0}. However in such an instance     care must be taken to observe that in fact you are representing     the constant functions using the sum of power terms convension     in which:     f(x, a0, a1, a2) =     constant * a1 (a1 * x +     a2)0 = constant *     a1     In particular, you will need to keep track of the model     parameters a1 and a2 above     when calling methods such as GetValueAt, in which you     will need to provide (in fact any) values for     a1 and a2.     Worked Example     We considered the function:     f(x, a0, a1,..., a8)     = a0(a1x + a2) +     a3(a4x + a5)2 +     (2.5)a6(a7a0 +     a8)0,     which can be set to an instance of this class by calling     this method with the parameters:                            logCoeffs = { 1.0, 1.0, 2.5 }         coefficients = { 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 }         constants = { 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 }         exponents = { 1.0, 2.0, 0.0 }               Therefore, for example when { a0,     a1, ..., a8 } = { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1     }, and evaluate the derivative and function itself using     GetValueAt we find that:                                                                                      x = 0                     x = 1                     x = 2                                                       ∂f/∂a0 = a0x +                     a1                     1                     2                     3                                                       ∂f/∂a1 =                     a0x                     0                     1                     2                                                       ∂f/∂a2 =                     a0                     1                     1                     1                                                       ∂f/∂a3 = (a4x +                     a5)2                     1                     4                     9                                                       ∂f/∂a4 = 2                     a3(a4x +                     a5)x                     0                     4                     12                                                       ∂f/∂a5 =                     2a3(a4x +                     a5)                     2                     4                     6                                                       ∂f/∂a6 = 2.5                     2.5                     2.5                     2.5                                                       ∂f/∂a7 = 0                     0                     0                     0                                                       ∂f/∂a8 = 0                     0                     0                     0                                                       f                     4.5                     8.5                     14.5                                                 Source Code Implementation: You can find the     source code implementation of this example within the     QAExample's within the Client/QAClients/ directory.

            <remarks>The first column returned is used for the X values, and the second for the Y values. The first also has special handling if dates are returned as the DateGrouping property can be used for intelligent date handling and grouping. The third column is optional and is used only for SplitBy. When a third column is set it is used automatically to create a unique series based on each unique value in this column.  NOTE: All date values in your SQL statements should be wrapped with the pound symbol: #10/25/2002#, regardless if Access or SQL server is used. Also the #StartDate# and #EndDate# tokens can be used in which case the dates set for these properties will be set in place of the tokens before the SqlStatement is executed.</remarks>

            <remarks>    The value of the cumulative frequency table values at a given     point is the number of elements within the data set above the     lowest value of that interval of the frequency table     constructed in accordance with the open left boundary     convention.     Example     Within this example we work through an illustration in     which the cumulative frequency table from above using the open     left boundary convention is evaluated.     Consider the set of boundaries { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },     which divide the real line into six sub-intervals. Now if we     use the open left boundary convention then the real line will     be divided into the sub-intervals:          (-infinity, 1], (1,2], (2,3], (3,4], (4,5], (5, infinity)          Note that, each point on the real line can be assigned to one     of these sub-intervals and therefore when assigning a data     point to one of these intervals there will only be one     sub-interval in which it belongs.     Therefore, if we consider the data set { 0.5, 1.4,     1.3, 2.0, 2.3, 4.5, 5.5}, if the assign this data set in     accordance with the above the conventions then we will have:     using Open Left Boundary (OLB) convention:                       Within the interval (-infinity, 1], we assign         the data element 0.5; and hence the frequency of         this interval is 1.         Within the interval (1, 2], we assign the data         element 1.4, 1.3, 2.0; and hence the frequency of         this interval (wrt OLB convention) is 3.         Within the interval (2, 3], we assign the data         element 2.3, and hence the frequency of this         interval (wrt OLB convention) is 1.         Within the interval (3, 4], we assign no data         elements, and hence the frequency of this interval (wrt OLB         convention) is 0.         Within the interval (4, 5], we assign the data         element 4.5, and hence the frequency of this         interval (wrt OLB convention) is 1.         Within the interval (5, infinity), we assign         the data element 5.5, and hence the frequency of         this interval (wrt OLB convention) is 1.               Now in follows that the associated values of the     cumulative frequency table are given by:                       Cumulative frequency table above -infinity is:         1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7         Cumulative frequency table above 1is: 1 + 0         + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6         Cumulative frequency table above 2is: 0 + 1         + 3 + 1 = 5         Cumulative frequency table above 3is: 1 + 3         + 1 = 5         Cumulative frequency table above 4is: 3 + 1         = 4         Cumulative frequency table above 5is:         1               Hence, for this case the series returned by this methods     to represent the cumulative frequency table would be: {7, 6,     5, 5, 4, 1}.</remarks>

Example     Within this example we work through an illustration in     which the cumulative frequency table from above using the open     left boundary convention is evaluated.     Consider the set of boundaries { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },     which divide the real line into six sub-intervals.

Within the interval (1, 2], we assign the data         element 1.4, 1.3, 2.0; and hence the frequency of         this interval (wrt OLB convention) is 3.         Within the interval (2, 3], we assign the data         element 2.3, and hence the frequency of this         interval (wrt OLB convention) is 1.

            <remarks>    The value of the cumulative frequency table values at a given     point is the number of elements within the data set below the     highest value of that interval of the frequency table     constructed in accordance with the open left boundary     convention.     Example     Within this example we work through an illustration in     which the cumulative frequency table from below using the open     left boundary convention is evaluated.     Consider the set of boundaries { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },     which divide the real line into six sub-intervals.

Within the interval (1, 2], we assign the data         element 1.4, 1.3, 2.0; and hence the frequency of         this interval (wrt OLB convention) is 3.         Within the interval (2, 3], we assign the data         element 2.3, and hence the frequency of this         interval (wrt OLB convention) is 1.         Within the interval (3, 4], we assign no data         elements, and hence the frequency of this interval (wrt OLB         convention) is 0.         Within the interval (4, 5], we assign the data         element 4.5, and hence the frequency of this         interval (wrt OLB convention) is 1.

Example     Consider the set of boundaries { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },     which divide the real line into six sub-intervals. Now if we     use the open left boundary convention then the real line will     be divided into the sub-intervals:          (-infinity, 1], (1,2], (2,3], (3,4], (4,5], (5, infinity)          Note that, each point on the real line can be assigned to one     of these sub-intervals and therefore when assigning a data     point to one of these intervals there will only be one     sub-interval in which it belongs.     Therefore, if we consider the data set { 0.5, 1.4,     1.3, 2.0, 2.3, 4.5, 5.5}, if the assign this data set in     accordance with the above the conventions then we will have:     using Open Left Boundary (OLB) convention:                       Within the interval (-infinity, 1], we assign         the data element 0.5; and hence the frequency of         this interval is 1.         Within the interval (1, 2], we assign the data         element 1.4, 1.3, 2.0; and hence the frequency of         this interval (wrt OLB convention) is 3.         Within the interval (2, 3], we assign the data         element 2.3, and hence the frequency of this         interval (wrt OLB convention) is 1.

Within the interval [1, 2), we assign the data         element 1.4, 1.3; and hence the frequency of this         interval (wrt ORB convention) is 2.         Within the interval [2, 3), we assign the data         element 2.0, 2.3; and hence the frequency of this         interval (wrt ORB convention) is 2.         Within the interval [3, 4), we assign no data         elements, and hence the frequency of this interval (wrt ORB         convention) is 0.         Within the interval [4, 5), we assign the data         element 4.5, and hence the frequency of this         interval (wrt ORB convention) is 1.         Within the interval [5, infinity), we assign         the data element 5.5, and hence the frequency of         this interval (wrt ORB convention) is 1.               Hence, in this case the series returned corresponding to     the frequency table will be {1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1}.</remarks>

            <summary>Calculates the frequency table with respect to the open right boundary convention for a discrete data set.</summary>
            <remarks>    Say for example the boundary points used are {b_1, b_2, ...,     b_n}, now the first term of the array returned which     represents the frequency table, is the number of elements from     the data set within the interval (-infinity, b_1), the     second term of the array returned is the number of elements     from the data set within the interval [b_1, b_2), and so     on...     Example     Consider the set of boundaries { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },     which divide the real line into six sub-intervals. Now if we     use the open right boundary convention then the real line will     be divided into the sub-intervals:          (-infinity, 1), [1, 2), [2, 3), [3, 4), [4, 5), [5,     infinity)          Note that, each point on the real line can be assigned to one     of these sub-intervals and therefore when assigning a data     point to one of these intervals there will only be one     sub-interval in which it belongs.

Within the interval [3, 4), we assign no data         elements, and hence the frequency of this interval (wrt ORB         convention) is 0.

            <remarks>    The relative frequency table normalized the data with regard to     the size of the data set before evaluating the frequency table     is exactly the same fashion as StatisticalFrequencyTableOL.     Further Explanation     If we are comparing two or more data sets then the     frequencies should be normalized to reflect the possible     different sizes of the data sets themselves. To normalize a     data set we much first divide the data set into a collection of     classes into which the elements are assigned. Here we assign     the data set in accordance with the open left boundary     convention where the class frequencies are just the number of     elements within each of the sub-intervals of the real line in     accordance with the open left boundary convention (see example     below).     To evaluate the relative frequency we apply the following     formula to each class:          Relative frequency = (class frequency) / (total     frequency)          where the class frequency is the number of data points within a     given sub-interval of the real line, and the total frequency is     the total number of elements within the data set     considered.     Example Illustration the Open Left Boundary Convention     Consider the set of boundaries { b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4,     b_5 }, where b_1 &lt; b_2 &lt; b_3 &lt; b_4 &lt;     b_5, which divide the real line into six sub-intervals. Now     if we use the open left boundary convention then the real line     will be divided into the sub-intervals:          (-infinity, b_1], (b_1,b_2], (b_2,b_3], (b_3,b_4], (b_4,b_5],     (5, infinity)          Note that, each point on the real line can be assigned to one     of these sub-intervals and therefore when assigning a data     point to one of these intervals there will only be one     sub-interval in which it belongs.</remarks>
